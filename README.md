# PyOpenCL-Windows
Install PyOpenCL for Windows 😉

### Why I made this Repo?
I wanted to install PyOpenCL on my Windows Laptop. I got many irritating issues. Again, I tried building OpenCL then PyOpenCL. Didn't help :(. Finally, I found a way to do it swifty. 
Yes, it did take a lot of head scratching before coming to this solution but ,yeah, as a respect to the **Open Source Community**, i wanted to help other developers who are still scratching their head or gave up 😂. 
So Go ahead and install PyOpenCL on Windows 🚀. 

### ⭐ Star the REPO if i was able to provide any help 😮

## Get Started 
```
